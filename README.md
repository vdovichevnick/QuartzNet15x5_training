During the completion of the diploma thesis, key models and technologies were analyzed that allow achieving results in teaching the model for the task of creating transcriptions of audio messages in Russian, and a dataset for training was assembled.
The model obtained during the study is 46% more accurate than its nearest competitor (the QuartzNet15x5 model trained by Sber) as part of the audio message processing task.
